    <article class="bio-article">
    		<p>I grew up in many states and even more cities/towns and even countries. My families military background was a big part of the reasoning behind the constant moving. I never exactly had a "normal" childhood, My parents are both immigrated from Belize so I was put into a place of independence at a young age which ended up being beneficial for me now that I'm older. I am a very restorative person now, I am pretty talented with dealing with problems that present themselves to me; I am great at figuring out resolutions to what is wrong. My teenage years were very significant to me because in those years I moved out of my parents house. Moving out gave me a talent for adaptability. Being an extroverted, woo (winning others over),  type of person it was easy for me to make connections and find the means to live and go to school without having to deal with  much of a struggle. I was truly blessed to meet so many wonderful people.
    		Now I'm a mother of two beautiful children; one boy (Connor) and one girl (Payton). They drive me everyday to be better and do better. Having children made me develop many wonderful and useful skills such as adaptability, connectedness, individualization, Consistency, and responsibility.  My children have become my whole life. I am everything I am to be the best mother I can possibly be.
    		Now in my life I'm focusing on success, I want to be successful in life to show my children that if mommy can do it they can do it.
